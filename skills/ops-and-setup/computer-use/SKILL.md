**What it is.** Computer Use in the ChatGPT desktop app's Codex view lets the agent operate real apps and browsers: read interfaces, click, type, and verify results. On macOS, it combines accessibility data with visual inspection and uses its own background cursor while the user works elsewhere. This closes the gap between writing code or explaining steps and actually using the interface to finish the job.

**When and how.** Use only when the user explicitly invokes this skill. Focus on **UI QA**—test components and user flows like a human, reproduce bugs, fix them, and retest—and **click-heavy setup**, especially Google Cloud Console forms and settings that otherwise require tedious manual back-and-forth. With the native Computer Use plugin enabled and user-approved permissions, give Codex a short `@Computer` instruction naming the target, desired outcome, constraints, and proof of completion, such as screenshots or verified settings. If your current agent lacks that capability, give the user a ready-to-paste Codex prompt instead. Ask before new permissions, charges, destructive changes, or sensitive account actions.
